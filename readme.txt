Manage 301 redirections, keep track of 404 errors, and improve your site, with no knowledge of Apache or Nginx needed.

== Description ==

Redirection is the most popular redirect manager for WordPress. With it you can easily manage 301 redirections, keep track of 404 errors, and generally tidy up any loose ends your site may have. This can help reduce errors and improve your site ranking.

Redirection is designed to be used on sites with a few redirects to sites with thousands of redirects.

It has been a WordPress plugin for over 10 years and has been recommended countless times. And it's free!

Full documentation can be found at [https://redirection.me](https://redirection.me)

= Redirect manager =

Create and manage redirects quickly and easily without needing Apache or Nginx knowledge. If your WordPress supports permalinks then you can use Redirection to redirect any URL.

There is full support for regular expressions so you can create redirect patterns to match any number of URLs.

The plugin can also be configured to monitor when post or page permalinks are changed and automatically create a redirect to the new URL.

= Conditional redirects =

In addition to straightforward URL matching you can redirect based on other conditions:

- Login status - redirect only if the user is logged in or logged out
- Browser - redirect if the user is using a certain browser
- Referrer - redirect if the user visited the link from another page
- Cookies - redirect if a particular cookie is set
- HTTP headers - redirect based on a HTTP header
- Custom filter - redirect based on your own WordPress filter

= Full logging =

A configurable logging option allows to view all redirects occurring on your site, including information about the visitor, the browser used, and the referrer. A 'hit' count is maintained for each redirect so you can see if a URL is being used.

Logs can be exported for external viewing, and can be searched and filtered for more detailed investigation.

Display geographic information about an IP address, as well as a full user agent information, to try and understand who the visitor is.

= Track 404 errors =

Redirection will keep track of all 404 errors that occur on your site, allowing you to track down and fix problems.

= Apache & Nginx support =

By default Redirection will manage all redirects using WordPress. However you can configure it so redirects are automatically saved to a .htaccess file and handled by Apache itself.

If you use Nginx then you can export redirects to an Nginx rewrite rules file.

= Import & Export =

The plugin has a fully-featured import and export system and you can:

- Import and export to Apache .htaccess
- Export to Nginx rewrite rules
- Copy redirects between sites using JSON
- Import and export to CSV for viewing in a spreadsheet
- Use WP CLI to automate import and export

You can also import from the following plugins:

- Simple 301 Redirects
- SEO Redirection
- Safe Redirect Manager
- WordPress old slug redirects

= Wait, it's free? =

Yes, it's really free. There's no premium version and no need to pay money to get access to features. This is a dedicated redirect management plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I want to use this instead of .htaccess? =

Ease of use.  Redirections are automatically created when a post URL changes, and it is a lot easier to manually add redirections than to hack around a .htaccess.  You also get the added benefit of being able to keep track of 404 errors.

= What is the performance of this plugin? =

The plugin works in a similar manner to how WordPress handles permalinks and should not result in any noticeable slowdown to your site.
