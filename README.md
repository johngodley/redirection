Redirection is a WordPress plugin to manage 301 redirections, keep track of 404 errors, and generally tidy up any loose ends your site may have. This is particularly useful if you are migrating pages from an old website, or are changing the directory of your WordPress installation.

Note: this is the current 'trunk' version of Redirection. It may be newer than what is in the WordPress.org plugin repository, and should be considered experimental.

## Installation
Redirection can be installed by visiting the WordPress.org plugin page:

https://wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/

## Customisation

### Request Information

The following WordPress filters are available for customisation of a server requests:

- `redirection_request_url` - The request URL
- `redirection_request_agent` - The request user agent
- `redirection_request_referrer` - The request referrer
- `redirection_request_ip` - The request IP address

### Logging

The following WordPress filters are available for customisation of logged data:

- `redirection_404_data` - Data to be inserted into the 404 table
- `redirection_log_data` - Data to be inserted into the redirect log table
- `redirection_log_404` - Return true if the current 404 page should be logged, false otherwise

Note that returning `false` from the filter will bypass the log.

### Redirect source and target

- `redirection_url_source` - The original URL used before matching a request. Return false to stop any redirection
- `redirection_url_target` - The target URL after a request has been matched (and after any regular expression captures have been replaced). Return false to stop any redirection

### Dynamic URL data

The following special words can be inserted into a target URL:

- `%userid%` - Insert user's ID
- `%userlogin%` - Insert user's login name
- `%userurl%` - Insert user's custom URL

### Management

- `redirection_permalink_changed` - return boolean if a post's permalink has changed
- `redirection_remove_existing` - fired when a post changes permalink and we need to clear existing redirects that might affect it

Additionally, if the target URL is a number without any slashes then Redirection will treat it as a post ID and redirect to the full URL for that post.

### Permissions

Access to the Redirection admin interface is given to `administrator`. You can modify this with the filter `redirection_role`, returning your
own WordPress access level.

## Building

Redirection is mostly a PHP plugin, but does contain files that need to be built. For this you'll need Gulp, Node, and Yarn installed. Install required modules with:

`yarn install`

### Language files

`gulp pot` - Updates language files

### React

Some parts of the UI are React and can be built with:

`yarn run dist`

To use in development mode then set `REDIRECTION_DEV_MODE` to true in PHP, and run:

`yarn start`

This will start Webpack in hot-reload mode, and you can make changes to JS files and have them auto-loaded.

### Releasing

Finally, to produce a release copy:

`gulp svn`

## Support

Please raise any bug reports or enhancement requests here. Pull requests are always welcome.
