Redirection
===========

Redirection is a WordPress plugin to manage 301 redirections, keep track of 404 errors, and generally tidy up any loose ends your site may have. This is particularly useful if you are migrating pages from an old website, or are changing the directory of your WordPress installation.

Note: this is the current 'trunk' version of Redirection. It may be newer than what is in the WordPress.org plugin repository, and should be considered experimental.

Installation
============
Redirection can be installed by visiting the WordPress.org plugin page:

https://wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/
